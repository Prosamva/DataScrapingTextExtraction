# Data Scraping and Text Extraction from Images
## From [Coding Club Posts](https://www.linkedin.com/company/coding-club/posts/?feedView=images)

The Coding Club Linkedin page has many posts with interesting programming questions. So, this program aims to scrape and process all those posts to generate a spreadsheet of all programming questions.
Used Python as the programming language, Selenium with ChromeDriver for web scraping images and Tesseract OCR engine to extract text and parsed the data into a .xslx file. About 1254 images were found on the page as of September 2021.<br>

Dataset of scraped images and program results can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1Vx6Upm_PiuQnxOpAbwr2jcFNedvaFxDS).
